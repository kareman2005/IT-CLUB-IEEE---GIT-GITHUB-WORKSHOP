# IT-CLUB-IEEE---GIT-GITHUB-WORKSHOP


This workshop is designed to be forked by students participating in the Git and GitHub
workshop at the Arab American University 2025/2026.

Students work together on a simple calculator application, where each team member
is responsible for implementing a specific function on their own branch.

The project focuses on:

    - Understanding version control concepts

    - Practicing branching and merging

    - Experiencing team collaboration


Instructions:

    1- A team leader forks the repository

    2- Authorizes the team members in the repository settings

    3- Assigns each team member a function to implement

    4- Each team member makes a branch locally of the main/master branch using their family name.

    5- Complete the task and push the changes to the local branch

    6- Push the branch to the remote repository

    7- The team leader manages the operation of merging the branches.


Mistakes to avoid:

    - Make changes to the main/master branch

    - Push changes to the remote main/master branch

    - Implementing other team members' functions
